My vision of a dynamic island for Hyprland. Originally developed for personal use, shared after genuine interest from the Reddit community.

## Features

**Contextual content** — automatically switches based on system state:
- Music player (album art, title, artist, progress)
- Discord voice call (live timer, mute button)
- Screen recording indicator
- Notifications with expand-to-read
- Clock + weather (default)

**Dual bubble** — Discord call pill appears alongside music player simultaneously  
**App Launcher** — island morphs into Spotlight-style launcher with fuzzy search and icons  
**Clipboard Viewer** — cliphist-based history with image/text detection  
**VPN badge** — lock icon with snap-shut animation under temperature  
**Pet pill** — animated cat reacts to music and notifications

## Architecture

Each component is a separate `PanelWindow`. IPC works via `inotifywait` on `/tmp/qs_*` files — no sockets, no daemons. The island hides itself when the launcher opens via `/tmp/qs_launcher_state`, creating a morph illusion since both windows share the same top-center position.
